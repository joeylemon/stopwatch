# stopwatch
A stopwatch that records your location.

### Build Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Open index.html with any browser
3. Ensure your browser has javascript running

### Notes
1. Files run locally seem to ask for permission for geolocation each time it wants to grab your position. Websites run remotely or on a local server don't do this. You can visit https://jlemon.org/projects/stopwatch to try the app on my web server.
